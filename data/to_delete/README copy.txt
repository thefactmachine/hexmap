CURRENT STATUS
proof of concept completed for 16 regions. 


CURRENTLY WORKING ON
Completing the hex centroid locations (in Visio) for the tourism boundaries (approx 34 polygons).

Once this step is completed. The locations of these points are manually copied to create a csv file
for an example (16 regions) please see data\region_coords.  

I think this process should be automated (in Visio) as it will facilitate rapid iteration


MILESTONES
1) proof of concept [complete]
2) centroid locations for region boundaries (16 polygons) [complete but needs rework]
3) centroid locations for tourism boundaries (34 polygons) [in progress]
4) centroid locations for territorial authorities (66 approx polygons) [not started]

5) review of results for steps 1..3 and rework to obtain aesthetic results

6) re-factor code to make it usable by team.
